# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
Implemented a supervised machine learning model using Python to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Utilized logistic regression, decision trees, and random forest classifiers on a highly imbalanced dataset. Performed data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model evaluation using precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
